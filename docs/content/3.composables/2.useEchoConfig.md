## Usage

This composable provides quick access to Nuxt configuration under the `echo` key. 
It is used as a part of the module implementation, so there is no particular need to use this in your application.

## Code sample

Here is an example of the call:

```typescript [SomeService.ts]
const echoConfig = useEchoConfig()

console.log(echoConfig.host) // print the broadcasting host URL
```
