## Usage

This composable provides quick access to app configuration under the `echo` key instead of calling `useAppConfig().echo`. 
It is used as a part of the module implementation, so there is no particular need to use this in your application.

## Code sample

Here is an example of the call:

```typescript [SomeService.ts]
const echoAppConfig = useEchoAppConfig()

// sets the Bearer token value to the storage
echoConfig.tokenStorage.set('auth_token_value')
```
