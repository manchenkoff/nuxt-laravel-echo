This Nuxt module for Laravel Echo integration provides a seamless experience with application broadcasting.

Since [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/broadcasting) requires additional authentication for Private channels, 
you may consider using this module to get this out-of-the-box. 

Nuxt Laravel Echo provides a wrapper on top of [laravel-echo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-echo) 
and [pusher.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pusher-js) packages, 
that takes care of creating an Echo instance and setting up an authentication handler.

## Key Features

This module includes a range of features designed to streamline broadcasting:

- **Sanctum**-based authentication
- **CSRF** cookie and token management for Private and Presence channels
- **CSR-only** mode (plugin is not loaded in SSR)
- **TypeScript** support
- **Simple** configuration
- Request interceptors, token storage, composables and more...

We recommend looking at our [breeze-nuxt](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-nuxt) template that works flawlessly with 
[breeze-api](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-api) Laravel application with preconfigured Sanctum and Echo modules.
